# 🏙️ Synthetic Oracle Tweets Dataset for Building Function Classification

This dataset contains **synthetic, LLM-generated tweets** designed as an **oracle benchmark** for studying the effects of noise in weakly supervised, text-based building function classification (BFC) tasks. It includes **15,222 multilingual tweets** generated for **6,000 real-world buildings** across **41 global cities**.

---

## 📦CSV Dataset Contents

Each entry in the CSV file dataset corresponds to a building and includes:
- **Building Name**
- **City**
- **Functional Tag** (e.g., `restaurant`, `apartment`)
- **Tweet Language Distribution** (e.g., `["English", "English"]`)
- **Generated Tweets** (semantically aligned with the building’s function)

### 📝 The metadata of all buildings are saved also in the metadata.jsonl file, Example entry is a building:

```json
{
  "building_name": "Merlex Auto Group",
  "building_city": "WashingtonDC",
  "building_tag": "Retail",
  "tweets_distribution": ["English", "English"],
  "tweets": [
    "Bought new rims here at Merlex Auto yesterday, totally transformed my ride! #AutoCare",
    "Merlex Auto Group really knows how to treat car lovers right. The staff? Super knowledgeable."
  ]
}
